# SudokuSolver
Uses double array formatting to sort through each row, clumn and box to determine whether a number would be fit for that space.
The solver is mainly focused on using for loops and if statements to achieve the process
Originally, the code is based on a sudoku board found online, this is due to the complexity of generating a sudoku board that is actually solvable
*Some number placements result in the board being unsolvable*
